The grids show the rainfall values across Australia in the form of two-dimensional array data. The data extends from 1910 onwards. North Bounding Latitude: -9.975; South Bounding Latitude: -44.525; East Bounding Longitude: 156.275; West Bounding Longitude: 111.975.\n<br/>\nThe analysis (grids) used for the service production are computer generated using a sophisticated analysis technique. It incorporates an optimised Barnes successive correction technique that applies a weighted averaging process to the station data. Topographical information is included by the use of rainfall ratio (actual rainfall divided by monthly average) in the analysis process.\n\nOn the maps each grid-point represents a rectangular area with sides 0.05⁰ latitude by 0.05⁰ longitude (approximately 5km by 5km). The size of the grids is limited by the data density across Australia.\n\nThis grid-point analysis technique provides an objective average for each grid square and enables useful estimates in data-sparse areas such as central Australia. However, in data-rich areas such as southeast Australia or in regions with strong gradients, “data smoothing” will occur resulting in grid-point values that may differ slightly from the exact rainfall amount measured at the contributing stations.\n<br/>\nThe observational (station) data on which the analyses were based have an associated accuracy of the order of 0.01 degrees (approximately 1km) or better.\n\nNote: The gridded data shown over ocean areas are statistical artefacts of the analysis scheme and not actual rainfall values",

          "description": "Root Zone Soil Moisture is the sum of water in the AWRA-L Upper and Lower soil layers and represents the percentage of available water content in the top 1 m of the soil profile. The maximum storage within the soil layer is calculated from the depth of the soil and the relative soil water storage capacity. The soil properties that control the storage of water are derived from the continental scale mapping within Australian Soil Resources Information System (Johnston et al., 2003). The relative available water capacity of the soil layer is derived from ASRIS information as the available water capacity of a layer divided by its thickness. Pedotransfer functions are used to relate soil hydraulic properties to soil textural class. Soil drainage and moisture dynamics are then based on water balance considerations for each soil layer. The shallow and deep rooted vegetation can both draw on this combined layer. <p> Actual soil moisture grids estimate the percentage of available water content rather than total soil water volume. Relative soil moisture grids, like the other grids, represent the long term deciles.</p>",

The size of the grids is limited by the data density across Australia.\n\nThe grid-point analysis technique provides an objective average for each grid square and enables useful estimates in data-sparse areas such as central Australia, However, in data-rich areas such as southeast Australia or in regions with strong gradients, “data smoothing” will occur resulting in grid-point values that may differ slightly from the exact temperature measured at contributing stations.\n\nThe observational (station) data on which the analyses were based have an associated accuracy of the order of 0.01 degrees (approximately 1km) or better.\n\nNote: The gridded data shown over ocean areas are statistical artefacts of the analysis scheme and not actual temperature values.",

The project aims to improve the resilience of farming businesses by providing localised facts about the likelihood, severity and duration of key weather variables in regions across the country. The weather and climate information will be delivered through a set of guides corresponding to Australia's Natural Resource Management regions. The project is a collaboration between the Bureau of Meteorology, the CSIRO and FarmLink Research. The guides have been developed in collaboration with representatives from each NRM region to ensure the information is tailored to the needs of local farmers and agribusinesses.",

              "description": "Data service visualisation of high resolution annual maximum temperature gridded datasets from 1910 onwards provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. The grids show the maximum temperatures values across Australia in the form of two-dimensional array data. The data extends from 1910 onwards. North Bounding Latitude: -9.975; South Bounding Latitude: -44.525; East Bounding Longitude: 156.275; West Bounding Longitude: 111.975.\n\nThe analyses (grids) are computer generated using a sophisticated analysis technique. It incorporates an optimised Barnes successive correction technique that applies a weighted averaging process to the station data. Topographical information is included in the use of anomalies (departures from average) in the analysis process. On the maps each grid-point represents an approximately square area with sides of about 5km (0.05 degrees). The size of the grids is limited by the data density across Australia.\n\nThe grid-point analysis technique provides an objective average for each grid square and enables useful estimates in data-sparse areas such as central Australia, However, in data-rich areas such as southeast Australia or in regions with strong gradients, “data smoothing” will occur resulting in grid-point values that may differ slightly from the exact temperature measured at contributing stations.\n\nThe observational (station) data on which the analyses were based have an associated accuracy of the order of 0.01 degrees (approximately 1km) or better.\n\nNote: The gridded data shown over ocean areas are statistical artefacts of the analysis scheme and not actual temperature values.",

This largely reflects the impact of an extended run of poor conditions in many livestock farming areas since 2015-16, which has led to reductions in beef cattle and sheep stocking rates, and to hay and grain holdings which, at least in the short-run, increases the drought risk faced by these farms (Hughes et al. 2020). Despite these trends, household income drought risk has remained relatively stable overtime, due largely to an increase in average farm size, which reduces the likelihood of low farm household incomes (see Hughes et al. 2020)."

              "description": "<p>Available water capacity is the maximum amount of plant-available water a soil can provide. The amount of water in soil is based on the amount rainfall, what proportion of rain infiltrates into the soil, and the soil's storage capacity. It is an indicator of a soil’s ability to retain water and make it sufficiently available for plant use. Water capacity is usually expressed as a volume fraction or percentage, or as a depth (in or cm).</p><p><h5>Why it is important?</h5>Soil is a major storage reservoir for water. Water availability is an important indicator because plant growth and soil biological activity depend on water for hydration and delivery of nutrients in solution. Runoff and leaching volumes are also determined by storage capacity and pore size distribution.</p><p>In areas where rain falls daily and supplies the soil with as much or more water than is removed by plants, available water capacity may be of little importance. However, in areas where plants remove more water than is supplied by precipitation, the amount of water held by the soil may be critical. Water held in the soil may be necessary to sustain plants between rainfall or irrigation events. By holding water for future use, soil buffers the plant – root environment against periods of water deficit.</p><p>What is this data used for? Available water capacity is used to develop water budgets, predict draughtiness, design and operate irrigation systems, design drainage systems, protect water resources, and predict yields.</p><img style='margin-top:1em; max-width: 90%' src='images/soil/available-water-capacity.png' />",

Soil organic matter (SOM) is difficult to measure directly, so laboratories tend to measure and report SOC.</p><p><h5>Why is organic carbon important in soil?</h5>Higher soil organic carbon promotes soil structure or tilth, meaning there is greater physical stability.

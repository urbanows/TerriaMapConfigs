      "description": "The USGS Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation (BISON) project is an online mapping information system consisting of a large collection of species occurrence datasets (e.g., plants and animals) found in the United States, U.S. Territories and relevant geospatial layers. Species occurrences are records of organisms at a particular time and location that are often collected as part of biological field studies and taxonomic collections. These data serve as a foundation for biodiversity and conservation research.",
